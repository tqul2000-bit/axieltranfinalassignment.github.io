      <h3>Psalm 22</h3>
      <p>
1 
My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
    Why are you so far from saving me,
    so far from my cries of anguish?</br>
2 
My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer,
    by night, but I find no rest.[b]</br>

3 
Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One;
    you are the one Israel praises.[c]</br>
4 
In you our ancestors put their trust;
    they trusted and you delivered them.</br>
5 
To you they cried out and were saved;
    in you they trusted and were not put to shame.</br>

6 
But I am a worm and not a man,
    scorned by everyone, despised by the people.</br>
7 
All who see me mock me;
    they hurl insults, shaking their heads.</br>
8 
“He trusts in the Lord,” they say,
    “let the Lord rescue him.
Let him deliver him,
    since he delights in him.”</br>

9 
Yet you brought me out of the womb;
    you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.</br>
10 
From birth I was cast on you;
    from my mother’s womb you have been my God.</br>

11 
Do not be far from me,
    for trouble is near
    and there is no one to help.</br>

12 
Many bulls surround me;
    strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</br>
13 
Roaring lions that tear their prey
    open their mouths wide against me.</br>
14 
I am poured out like water,
    and all my bones are out of joint.
My heart has turned to wax;
    it has melted within me.</br>
15 
My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd,
    and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth;
    you lay me in the dust of death.</br>

16 
Dogs surround me,
    a pack of villains encircles me;
    they pierce[e] my hands and my feet.</br>
17 
All my bones are on display;
    people stare and gloat over me.</br>
18 
They divide my clothes among them
    and cast lots for my garment.</br>

19 
But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
    You are my strength; come quickly to help me.</br>
20 
Deliver me from the sword,
    my precious life from the power of the dogs.</br>
21 
Rescue me from the mouth of the lions;
    save me from the horns of the wild oxen.</br>

22 
I will declare your name to my people;
    in the assembly I will praise you.</br>
23 
You who fear the Lord, praise him!
    All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
    Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!</br>
24 
For he has not despised or scorned
    the suffering of the afflicted one;
he has not hidden his face from him
    but has listened to his cry for help.</br>

25 
From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
    before those who fear you[f] I will fulfill my vows.</br>
26 
The poor will eat and be satisfied;
    those who seek the Lord will praise him—
    may your hearts live forever!</br>

27 
All the ends of the earth
    will remember and turn to the Lord,
and all the families of the nations
    will bow down before him,</br>
28 
for dominion belongs to the Lord
    and he rules over the nations.</br>

29 
All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
    all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
    those who cannot keep themselves alive.</br>
30 
Posterity will serve him;
    future generations will be told about the Lord.</br>
31 
They will proclaim his righteousness,
    declaring to a people yet unborn:
    He has done it!</br>

      <h3>Psalm 23</h3>
      <p>
1 
The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.</br>
2 
    He makes me lie down in green pastures,
he leads me beside quiet waters,</br>
3 
    he refreshes my soul.
He guides me along the right paths
    for his name’s sake.</br>
4 
Even though I walk
    through the darkest valley,[a]
I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
    they comfort me.</br>

5 
You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.</br>
6 
Surely your goodness and love will follow me
    all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    forever.</br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="lyrics3" class="lyrics-box">
      <h3>Psalm 77</h3>
      <p>
1 
I cried out to God for help;
    I cried out to God to hear me.</br>
2 
When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;
    at night I stretched out untiring hands,
    and I would not be comforted.</br>
3 
I remembered you, God, and I groaned;
    I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.[b]</br>
4 
You kept my eyes from closing;
    I was too troubled to speak.</br>
5 
I thought about the former days,
    the years of long ago;</br>
6 
I remembered my songs in the night.
    My heart meditated and my spirit asked:</br>
7 
“Will the Lord reject forever?
    Will he never show his favor again?</br>
8 
Has his unfailing love vanished forever?
    Has his promise failed for all time?</br>
9 
Has God forgotten to be merciful?
    Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”</br>

10 
Then I thought, “To this I will appeal:
    the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.</br>
11 
I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
    yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.</br>
12 
I will consider all your works
    and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”</br>

13 
Your ways, God, are holy.
    What god is as great as our God?</br>
14 
You are the God who performs miracles;
    you display your power among the peoples.</br>
15 
With your mighty arm you redeemed your people,
    the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.</br>

16 
The waters saw you, God,
    the waters saw you and writhed;
    the very depths were convulsed.</br>
17 
The clouds poured down water,
    the heavens resounded with thunder;
    your arrows flashed back and forth.</br>
18 
Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,
    your lightning lit up the world;
    the earth trembled and quaked.</br>
19 
Your path led through the sea,
    your way through the mighty waters,
    though your footprints were not seen.</br>

20 
You led your people like a flock
    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</br>

You are good, and what you do is good;

Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies,

Their hearts are callous and unfeeling,

It was good for me to be afflicted

The law from your mouth is more precious to me

      <h3>Psalm 139</h3>
      <p>
        
1 
You have searched me, Lord,
    and you know me.</br>

2 
You know when I sit and when I rise;
    you perceive my thoughts from afar.</br>

3 
You discern my going out and my lying down;
    you are familiar with all my ways.</br>

4 
Before a word is on my tongue
    you, Lord, know it completely.</br>

5 
You hem me in behind and before,
    and you lay your hand upon me.</br>

6 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
    too lofty for me to attain.</br>

7 
Where can I go from your Spirit?
    Where can I flee from your presence?</br>

8 
If I go up to the heavens, you are there;
    if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.</br>

9 
If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
    if I settle on the far side of the sea,</br>

10 
even there your hand will guide me,
    your right hand will hold me fast.</br>

11 
If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me
    and the light become night around me,”</br>

12 
even the darkness will not be dark to you;
    the night will shine like the day,
    for darkness is as light to you.</br>

13 
For you created my inmost being;
    you knit me together in my mother's womb.</br>

14 
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
    your works are wonderful,
    I know that full well.</br>

15 
My frame was not hidden from you
    when I was made in the secret place,
    when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.</br>

16 
Your eyes saw my unformed body;
    all the days ordained for me were written in your book
    before one of them came to be.</br>
17 
How precious to me are your thoughts,[a] God!
    How vast is the sum of them!</br>

18 
Were I to count them,
    they would outnumber the grains of sand—
    when I awake, I am still with you.</br>

19 
If only you, God, would slay the wicked!
    Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!</br>

20 
They speak of you with evil intent;
    your adversaries misuse your name.</br>

21 
Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord,
    and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?</br>

22 
I have nothing but hatred for them;
    I count them my enemies.</br>

23 
Search me, God, and know my heart;
    test me and know my anxious thoughts.</br>

24 
See if there is any offensive way in me,
    and lead me in the way everlasting.</br>
